            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>WHen I was first deſired to Preach the following Sermon, upon the occaſion of erecting an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in the Pariſh-Church of <hi>Bridgwater;</hi> I was at the ſame time deſired to anſwer the Objections against Inſtrumental Muſick in Churches, which were publiſhed ſome time before that, by an Anony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Author, in a Book, Entituled, <hi>A Letter to a Friend in the Country,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in Anſwer to Mr.</hi> Newt<hi>'s Sermon,</hi> &amp;c. which I have endeavoured to do with the utmost plainneſs and brevity I could. However I could not ſo fully make reply to one Objection in my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon as I would have done, and therefore am willing to ſay ſomething to it here. But becauſe I find the Learned Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> hath done it in a Book of his, lately pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, Entituled, <hi>A Treatiſe concerning the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Inſtrumental Muſick in Holy Offices;</hi> I ſhall only repeat his Anſwer here, for the Benefit of thoſe who have not ſeen his Book, with one Remark of my own.</p>
            <p>The Objection is, That<note n="*" place="margin">A. N. p. 20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> ſeveral of the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers thought Inſtrumental Muſick proper to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> State, <hi>viz. Clemens Alexand. Iſidore Peluſiota, St. Chryſoſtom, Theodoret,</hi> and <hi>Author. Quaeſt. &amp; Reſponſ. ad Orthodox.</hi> and he quotes out of their Works certain Sentences to juſtify this.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:151334:4"/>
            <p>Now to this Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> replies,<note n="*" place="margin">Dod. Sect. 29.</note> 
               <hi>1.</hi> Thoſe Fathers were no more able to judge what was proper to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> State than we, becauſe though they are very ancient, yet the earlieſt of them is ſhort of the Apoſtolical Age a great many years; and ſo they were capable of knowing the Reaſonings of that Age only by Tradition, which we are in like manner as well. And therefore in their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings they are to be heeded no farther than it appears they were agreeable to the Reaſonings of the Apoſtolical Age; and Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> ſhews,<note n="*" place="margin">Dodwel Sect. 30.</note> That in the Apoſtles time they reaſoned quite otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He<note n="†" place="margin">Ibid.</note> ſuppoſes this Opinion of theirs might be taken up for want of conſidering the true Reaſon why Inſtrumental Muſick was not uſed in Churches in their time and before. He ſuppoſes they might imagine (for indeed no Reaſon or Tradition for this Opinion of theirs is produced) that the cauſe thereof was, that it was looked upon by the Ages before them to be a legal Conſtitution; whereas the true Reaſon might not be ſuch an Opinion, nor any diſlike of it. There might be many Reaſons aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for that, but that which Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> offers ſeems to be very good, which is this. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder the Jewiſh Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, Inſtruments were uſed no where but in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple where the High-prieſt preſided, who had right over all the <hi>Jews</hi> whereſoever diſperſed, as in like manner he lays down the Apoſtolical Church at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had right over all the Churches in the World; therefore as it was the peculiar Prerogative of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> High-priest to have Inſtruments in the Temple only, ſo it might be thought it was the peculiar Prerogative of the chief Apoſtle to have Inſtruments only in his Church, which might be the Reaſon why no Churches in the Apoſtles time did intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them. And again, when the Apoſtolical Church was extinct by the death of the last Apoſtle, he ſuppoſes
<pb facs="tcp:151334:4"/>every Church (though they were then all equal among themſelves) might be afraid to introduce them, lest they ſhould ſeem to challenge Catholick Preheminence thereby, till time had worn out the Memory of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Prerogative. This Reaſon theſe Fathers not being aware of, might therefore take hold of that other by conjecture. Thus far Mr. <hi>Dodwell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I add, That the moſt ancient of theſe Fathers, <hi>viz. Clemens Alexandrius,</hi> is not at all of this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, for however thoſe allegorical Expreſſions quoted out of him may ſeem at first ſight, it will be plain to any one who reads the whole ſeveral Diſcourſes, he means not to condemn the ſound uſe of Muſick, as I could eaſily ſhew, were it material; however I ſhall here preſent you with one Sentence out of him to confirm what I ſay, which becauſe it is delivered in plain proper Terms, by no means to be thought allegorical, will clearly ſhew that he approved of Inſtrumental Muſick in Devotion, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the other Quotations. The Sentence is in the 2d Book of his <hi>Paedagog.</hi> ſome few Lines under the Quotation there, where he ſaith,<note n="*" place="margin">Paedag. lib. 2. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c.</note> 
               <q>
                  <hi>And if you deſire to ſing and play upon an Harp or Lute it is not blame-worthy, for in that you imitate the</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew <hi>King, well-pleaſing to God;</hi>
               </q> and he quotes the Words of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> to juſtify it. This is all I ſhall ſay upon this Head, and when all is done I am ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, if I could ſay as much as I ſhould deſire, either here or in my Sermon, for the lawfulneſs of Inſtrumental Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, thoſe who are captious and ungovernable, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver want Arguments to uphold their Nonconformity; as on the contrary thoſe who are endued with a mild, gracious Diſpoſition, will interpret and weigh every thing with Candor. And ſuch I could wiſh all my Readers were, not only for the Good of the Cauſe I here under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb facs="tcp:151334:5"/>take to defend, but alſo that I may be the more eaſily born with for my Faults which may have eſcaped my Knowledge.</p>

            <p>GReat and Wonderful is the Sympathy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Muſical Sounds and the Paſſions of Man; and there is hardly any affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our Minds which ſuitable Notes cannot excite. There is a ſort of Muſick will make you light and airy, another grave and ſevere; ſome kind of it is more eſpecially apt to compoſe the Mind, to render it calm, and take off that rugged<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and moroſeneſs of Temper which renders ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny unfit for Society: Upon which account no doubt it was that the famous Lawgivers <hi>Lycurgus</hi> and <hi>Numa</hi> provided for the encouragement of it, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hereby to incline Mens Minds to what their Laws could not force. Theſe Things Muſick doth perform, not faintly and weakly, but powerfully. And indeed ſtrange are the effects which have been aſcribed to it; as the driving the Evil Spirit from <hi>Saul,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">1 Sam. 16.23.</note> which, ſince the power of the Devil can be but ſmall when the Faculties of the Mind are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, is to be imputed to the natural efficacy of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:151334:6"/>it.<note n="*" place="margin">See more <hi>Dowell,</hi> p. 17. and on.</note> So the Venemous biting of the <hi>Tarantula,</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> Spider, is ſaid to be cured by the Application of certain Muſical Notes. And this is undoubted, that hardly any thing doth more ſtrongly charm and delight the Mind than this doth, as wiſe Men, in all Ages, have found and teſtified; and beſides, when ſuitable Harmony is adapted to well compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Words, it imprints them the more upon the Mind, and doth both add a force and grace to the Words, and alſo receive from them a greater Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of moving the Spirits, than otherwiſe it would have: And hence it is that the lofty Strains of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry, when expreſſed in melodious Songs, do ſo mightily delight and affect us. But that which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all doth recommend Muſick to us, is the ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of the beſt ſort of it to exalt our Affections in the Worſhip of God, and to raiſe our Souls to ſuch a degree of Love, Reverence and Admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in our Praiſes of the Divine Being, as few Things elſe are able to do. And this Power it appears to have, not only from the experience of moſt Men, but becauſe the Holy Scriptures both of the Old and New Teſtament do preſcribe it; for which no other Reaſon can be given, but that it is helpful to advance Devotion: As to mention only Proofs from the New Teſtament, the words of my Text, ſo <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Teaching and admoniſhing one another in Pſalms, and Hymns, and ſpiritual Songs, ſinging with Grace in your Hearts to the Lord.</hi> So <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.13. <hi>Is any one merry? let him ſing Pſalms.</hi> But becauſe there are two ſorts of Muſick, <hi>viz.</hi> Vocal and Inſtrumental, and the New Teſtament ſpeaks only of Singing, as is thought by ſome, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an Opinion is ſpread abroad, that Inſtrumental
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:151334:6"/>Muſick is by no means to be admitted in the Service of God; wherefore I ſhall in the proſecution of this Diſcourſe ſhew,
<list>
                  <item>1. That Inſtrumental Muſick is not only lawful, but commendable in the Worſhip of God.</item>
                  <item>2. I ſhall anſwer ſome Objections which are brought againſt it.</item>
                  <item>3. I ſhall make an Improvement of what hath been ſaid.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I begin with the Firſt, to ſhew that Inſtrumental Muſick is not only lawful, but commendable in the Worſhip of God.</p>
            <p>This may be very probably argued from the Words of my Text, becauſe thoſe <hi>Pſalms</hi> which the Apoſtle exhorts Chriſtians to ſing, are the ſame which the <hi>Jews</hi> were wont to ſing to Muſical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments in their daily Service; and it may be reaſonably concluded, that as we are to imitate the <hi>Jews</hi> in ſinging them, ſo we may alſo follow their example in applying Inſtruments thereto. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I cannot ſee how the Apoſtles can avoid the cenſure of omitting a moſt neceſſary Caution, in not forbidding us to imitate the <hi>Jews</hi> in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, ſince they preſcribed an imitation of them in ſinging, a Thing ſo near a kin to it, and alſo in regard Man's own Reaſon is apt to ſuggeſt the thing to be very fit to be ſo applied, as appears by the general approbation of it by ſo many Nations in their Worſhip of God, and by all Men, but thoſe whoſe prejudiced Minds and foul Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons encline them to think that God is to be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with nothing but what is Rigid and Auſtere.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As it cannot be denied but that Inſtrumental Muſick was very lawful in the Worſhip of the <hi>Jews,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:151334:7"/>becauſe it was appointed by God's Prophets, and by <hi>David,</hi> who was a Man after God's own Heart, and becauſe it appears God approved of it by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding it to be reſtored in <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s time accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Pattern of <hi>David, &amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.25. So from hence doth it follow, that it is very law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be uſed in our Worſhip, becauſe we are to proſecute the ſame end which the <hi>Jews</hi> were when they made uſe of it, <hi>viz.</hi> to praiſe God with exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Minds; and why we may not uſe the ſame means to advance that end, ſince it is every whit as powerful in its own nature now to promote it as it was then, cannot well be ſurmiſed. And I think if any one ſhould ſay the nature of Inſtrumental Muſick were changed ſince that time, or that the good effect of it in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Service were owing more to an extraordinary Grace God was pleaſed to conjoyn with it, than to its natural Power,<note n="*" place="margin">See more <hi>Dodwell,</hi> Sect. 11.</note> he would ſeem like one that was put to his ſhift. There are ſome ends indeed which the <hi>Jews</hi> were obliged to proſecute and we are not, as to typifye the Death of Chriſt by a bloody repreſentation; and as theſe ends are aboliſhed, ſo in all reaſon the means too <hi>viz.</hi> ſacrificing living Creatures, upon which act it happens that there is not the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for retaining Sacrificing as there is for retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Inſtrumental Muſick, whoſe end will always remain. Again, ſome of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Inſtitutions were Conveyances of Grace and ſpiritual Benefits like our Sacraments, not by their own native ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, but by a ſpecial Power ſuperadded to them under the old Diſpenſation, which now in all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon are aboliſhed too, becauſe we have no proof that God will concur with them in that extraordinary
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:151334:7"/>manner he did heretofore. To this purpoſe did Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion ſerve, and alſo the bloody Sacrifices, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>They which eat of the Sacrifices, are partakers of the Altar.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 10-18.</note> Now as for Inſtrumental Muſick, beſides that we do not uſe it as a means of conferring Grace extraordinarily, there is no colour of reaſon to be brought that ever it was ſo uſed among the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſeeing there is not one Word in either the old or New Teſtament, or in the Writings of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and ſeeing its natural efficacy to ſtir up the Mind religiouſly, doth therefore afford ſo eaſie an account of its eſtabliſhment, as is to exalt Mens Minds and Devotion. Neither can Inſtrumental Muſick be thought a meer Type, becauſe no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can be brought to prove it ſo, unleſs grounded upon very ſlender Suppoſitions, which will equally prove ſinging of that nature; and which doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear very improbable, when put in the ballance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that which makes its natural Conduciveneſs to promote pious affections the cauſe of its eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But,</p>
            <p n="3">3. If Inſtrumental Muſick notwithſtanding were a Type heretofore, yet ſince it is effectual to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the ſame end which ſinging is, and in the ſame manner, and beſides to render the ſinging more powerful to advance what it is appointed for, then why ſhould not this be as fit to be introduced as that? Certainly there can no reaſon be given ſince the Church hath both a Command and a Power to ordain whatſoever is to edification in the external Worſhip of God; as may be proved by Reaſon and Scripture, and will be ſhewed in my Anſwer to the Objections. For upon the Suppoſition, tho' the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:151334:8"/>Apoſtle mentions Singing, and not the other, yet that can make no difference as to the lawfulneſs of either. Neither can it any way be proved that a Thing is therefore uncapable of being admitted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Chriſtian Inſtitutions, becauſe it was made uſe of as a Type among the <hi>Jews;</hi> Altho', at the ſame time, it will be impoſſible to prove that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental Muſick was ſo uſed. All that remains then upon this Head, is to prove that thoſe Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties I have laid down do belong to it, and that they do ſo, appears by the conſent of moſt Men herein who are not prepoſſeſſed or of an untoward Nature; and I know no better Touchſtone of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Power of a Thing to excite the Affections re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly, than the general Judgments of the wiſeſt Men. But it is ſaid,<note n="*" place="margin">A. N. p. 16.</note> Singing is an articulate Sound but organical Muſick an inarticulate one; and alſo that<note n="†" place="margin">Ibid.</note> Singing expreſſes methodically the Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Soul, but the other not. But what if it be inarticulate, or do not expreſs the Conceptions of the Mind methodically? Muſt all Things of that nature be baniſhed from God's Service? What then will become of kneeling, lifting up the Hands, Eyes, and the like? Altho', with Submiſſion I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive theſe Things do no more belong to the Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Modulation of the Voice, than to the Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Pipes, but to the pronunciation of the Words which one accompanies as well as the other. It is ſaid too that Orginical Muſick<note n="*" place="margin">A. N. p. 50. &amp; 51.</note> doth not better the Singing, and that<note n="*" place="margin">A. N. p. 50. &amp; 51.</note> nothing can do that but Inſtruction from a Singing-Maſter. 'Tis true, the moſt proper way to teach People to ſing well is a Singing-Maſter's Inſtructions; yet an Organ will be of uſe even to the Maſters themſelves when they
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:151334:8"/>ſing in Parts eſpecially, to prevent Diſcord and Miſtakes, and to keep their Voices up to their true pitch; for it is eaſie to obſerve in Cathedrals how a whole Choir falls conſiderably from the Key they began in, when they ſing without the Organ. 'Tis true likewiſe that many hold Vocal Muſick to be ſweeter than Inſtrumental; yet I think no compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Judge will deny that a Conſort of Vocal and Inſtrumental together is ſweeter than either alone. In large Parochical Congregations this may eaſily be diſcerned, becauſe an Organ very much hides and covers the harſhneſs of many Voices too often complained of there. But farther it is urg'd, the Apoſtles and Primitive Chriſtians are much to be blamed if the uſe be ſo, for not uſing Inſtruments, and that therefore<note n="*" place="margin">A. N. p. 79.</note> their Devotion was not ſo ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual (or exalted) as ours; but indeed their nearneſs to our Saviour's time, and the commonneſs of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Gifts and operations, then among them, muſt needs imprint ſuch ſtrong Ideas of Love, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, and the like, upon their Minds, as to raiſe their Souls to a great pitch of Piety; and beſides the rage of Perſecution which at firſt prevailed and held on after miraculous Gifts were diſcontinued, as it rendred their ſtate improper to admit ſuch or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namental Helps as this, more ſuitable to the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous eſtate of the Church; which is enough to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them from Blame herein, in regard the uſe of Inſtruments is not abſolutely neceſſary, ſo did it moſt ſurely affect their Minds in ſuch ſort as was ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their condition at leaſt. However I Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not but in after Ages they ſtood in need of this Help as well as we; and many of thoſe who want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, muſt be thought to have their Minds leſs
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:151334:9"/>exalted in their Devotion oftentimes, than they would have been if they had enjoyed the ſound uſe hereof.<note n="*" place="margin">See the Preface.</note> Tho' much may be ſaid to excuſe their neglect in not introducing them ſpeedily, but as a farther Anſwer hereunto, ſince it is evident that Organical Muſick was not introduced among the <hi>Jews</hi> till <hi>David</hi>'s time, ſeveral hundreds of Years after their Sectlement in <hi>Canaan,</hi> it may be ſaid as well that the <hi>Jews</hi> before <hi>David</hi>'s time did not Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God in ſo exalted a manner, as they did after, and were therefore to be blamed; and whatſoever Anſwer may be given to this will ſerve in our Caſe. But it is urged, the Primitive Chriſtians thought the uſe of Organs unlawful and ſeveral<note n="*" place="margin">See the Preface.</note> Authorities are produced to prove it, which when enquired into, will hardly be found to vote on the ſide they are pretended; but I have not time to examine them here, and when all is done no humane Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the World is of force againſt apparent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Scripture; and thoſe who are againſt us herein, will take none againſt their Opinions.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Inſtrumental Muſick is lawful and commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.8, 9. <hi>And when he had taken the Book, the four Beaſts and twenty four Elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them Harps and Golden Vials full of Odors, which are the Prayers of the Saints, and they ſung a New Song;</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>Thou art worthy to take the Book and to open the Seals thereof, for thou waſt ſlain and haſt redeemed us to God by the Blood,</hi> &amp;c.</q> Now if Muſical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments were unlawful in the Chriſtian Service on Earth, then certainly the Holy Ghoſt would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have repreſented the Worſhippers of Chriſt in Heaven, uſing them in their own Act of Worſhip;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:151334:9"/>and then how can any one doubt but that this is a fit Precedent for us to introduce them in ours, ſince this relation is no obſcure Prophecy, but plain mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact? It will not follow as well that<note n="†" place="margin">A. N. p. 30.</note> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe is to be eſtabliſhed in the Chriſtian Service from hence (tho' at the ſame time I ſhall not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert the unlawfulneſs of that) becauſe the Elders are not repreſented uſing Vials of Odors as their own Act of Worſhip, but to denote the Prayers of the Saints by a viſible Repreſentation, as moſt Things were delivered to <hi>John</hi> in Viſion, and as it was impoſſible to ſet forth the Prayers of others to the Eye, unleſs by ſome corporeal adumbration of them, ſo nothing was ſo fit to ſet them forth by as Incenſe, which was a known Type of Prayers. Neither doth it follow that Altars and the like which are repreſented to be in Heaven in this Book of <hi>Revelations</hi> are to be eſtabliſhed now, becauſe the Angels are no where brought in uſing them in their own Worſhip, but repreſenting ſomething fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thereby. Nor again, becauſe the Joy of a<note n="*" place="margin">A. N. p. 29.</note> Marrriage-Feaſt is ſaid to bear reſemblance to the Joys of Heaven; doth it therefore follow, that Laughter, Dancing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Expreſſions of Joy at a Marriage-Feaſt, are to be introduced, becauſe we are no ways obliged to endeavour to poſſeſs our ſelves of any thing which can be compared to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Happineſs, and beſides it were vain to do it. As to what is ſaid, that it may as well be argued<note n="†" place="margin">A. N. p. 31.</note> when Antichriſt ſhall fall the Church ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from Inſtrumental Muſick, becauſe <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.22. after an account is given of the fall of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>And the Voice of Harpers and Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, and of Pipers and Trumpeters, ſhall no more at

And again, if Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical Muſick in Churches muſt be accounted Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful from hence, then will alſo by the ſame reaſon the exerciſe of Trades, Marriage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Becauſe <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> is equally threatned to be depriv'd of theſe things.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, if a general concurrence in the Opinion of the Lawfulneſs of Inſtrumental Muſick be an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for it, we have that to urge; as to mention only Proteſtants, the Judgment of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd Diſſenter, whoſe Arguments are publick: Then we find great part of the Proteſtant Churches in <hi>Germany</hi> uſing Organs, as alſo in <hi>Swedeland, Denmark, Switzerland,</hi> part of <hi>Poland,</hi> and in <hi>Holland</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, it was Decreed by the National Synod at <hi>Middleburg,</hi> Ann. 1581. and of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> Ann. 1594. to prohibit Organical Muſick, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept during Divine Service, <hi>extra cultum, poſt, aut an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te conciones,</hi> as the Learned <hi>Durell</hi> proves, from<note n="*" place="margin">Schookius Exercit. <hi>39.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Schookius Exercit.</hi> 30.9. but that was only intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take off the abuſe of Church Muſick, that it might not be uſed as an Entertainment to Idle Perſons,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:151334:10"/>but be applied only to Pſalm Singing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, our Adverſaries taking hold of this, pretend<note n="*" place="margin">A. N. p. 37.</note> that Organs were introduc'd into the Dutch Churches by ſome Magiſtrates, againſt the conſent of the Dutch Miniſters, and in their Quotations they deliver only part of the Decrees, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">A. N. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </note> that they would endeavour to prevail with the Magiſtratesto Baniſh Organs out of their Temples, leaving out (except during Divine Service) and for this they quote <hi>Voet,</hi> but I think the Words of the Decree it ſelf deliver'd by <hi>Schookius,</hi> is a clearer Evidence of the approbation of Organs by the Dutch, than is the partial Quotation of <hi>Voet,</hi> (a profeſs'd Enemy to Organs) of the contrary: thus much for the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and Commendableneſs of Inſtrumental Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I come to anſwer ſome Objections, which are made againſt Inſtrumental Muſick.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is Objected, that<note n="*" place="margin">A. N. p. 70.</note> Inſtrumental Muſick is a part of the Ceremonial Law, becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Trumpets, which are Muſical Inſtruments. To which I anſwer, they were not appointed for thoſe ends which Inſtrumental Muſick was, becauſe among all the uſes which are reckon'd up for them, <hi>Numb.</hi> 10. there is no mention of applying them to Singing, or of Sounding them Harmoniouſly, and accordingly they were never Sounded in the Conſort of the Temple Muſick, but in the intermiſſions of the Muſick, as Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> ſhews;<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Lightfoot.</hi> Vol. 5. p. 920.923.</note> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tho' at the 10th Verſe of this Chapter, it is Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd the Prieſts ſhould Blow with Trumpets over the Sacrifice; yet can it not be ſuppoſed that this Blowing was any other than making a great noiſe, for the foregoing Reaſons; and as Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:151334:11"/>ſhews,<note n="*" place="margin">Ibid.</note> who tells us, the Blowing was only a <hi>Taratantara,</hi> as he calls it, which cannot be thought Muſical.</p>
            <p>But it is urged, it was a part of the Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Law, becauſe Inſtituted by <hi>David;</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">A. N. p. 71.</note> and to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie this ſuppoſition, many other ſuppoſitions are brought too tedious to be here examin'd; however, to take off the pretence of the concluſiveneſs of this at leaſt; I have to ſay, that Singing was Inſtituted by <hi>David,</hi> at the ſame time that Inſtrumental Muſick was; But this being a Duty now under the Goſpel, could be no part of the Ceremonial Law, according to our Adverſaries way of reaſoning; and why this other inſtitution of <hi>David</hi>'s, ſhould be Ceremonial then, will not appear from his appointment of it barely. But again, Vocal Muſick may ſeem more Ceremonial than Inſtrumental, becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf Compoſed a Song, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. And beſides, God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Moſes</hi> to Teach the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> a Song, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.—19. Whereas <hi>Moſes</hi> never ſpake a word concerning Inſtrumental Muſick; and if he had, I believe it would be no eaſie matter to prove Singing more moral than the other. But however, if Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Muſick had been appointed as a Ceremony, or a Type, although no obligation would have lain on us, to have uſed it meerly becauſe it was ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; and though it would have been fooliſh to have uſed it as a Type, when the thing Typified were accompliſhed; yet ſince it hath a natural power to promote a Moral end, I do not ſee why it may not be uſed by us to that end, becauſe our Adverſaries can produce neither Scripture nor Reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn ſuch a Practice.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is objected,<note n="*" place="margin">A. N. p. 78.</note> Chriſtians are to Worſhip
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:151334:11"/>God in Spirit and Truth, without multiplicity of pompous Rites and Ceremonies, which God hath not Inſtituted;<note n="*" place="margin">A. N. p. 52.</note> and tho' ſome may pretend the affections of their Souls are ſtirred up by the Benefit of Inſtrumental Muſick, yet that doth not juſtifie its ſtated uſe, for then a Crucifix, a Death's Head, a Skeleton and the like, the ſight whereof may by chance have the ſame effect, are fit to be introduc'd too, and likewiſe Sacrificing to repreſent the Death of Chriſt paſt. Tho' at the ſame time Men may miſtake a cheerful agitation of the Spirits for a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious affection, and there are ſome who profeſs this ſort of Muſick doth Diſtract them. This is the Objection in its utmoſt comprehenſion. To which I anſwer, the Worſhipping God with pompous Rites and Ceremonies in an ill Senſe, can be nothing elſe but accounting Divine Worſhip, to conſiſt in the outward performance of ſuch, or thinking to pleaſe God meerly with a gay ſhow, which were to diſhonour him. But as I think none can deny, that by reaſon of the natural influence which external Objects and Performances have upon our Souls, our Devotion may be heightned by the ſuitable Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of ſuch, ſo to introduce and make uſe of thoſe which apparently tend to promote Piety, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to raiſe our affections thereby; tho' they may ſeem pompous to our prejudic'd Adverſaries, and tho' Chriſt hath not particularly ſpecified them, will be very lawful, becauſe this is a means to improve our Spiritual Worſhip, as a pair of Spectacles is a means to improve the faculty of Seeing. Beſides, the Apoſtles of Chriſt have given us a general Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to appoint ſuch things, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.26. <hi>Let all things be done to Edification;</hi> and Ver. 40. <hi>Let all
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:151334:12"/>things be done decently and in order.</hi> And again, as our Lord hath no where forbidden us to do thus, ſo hath he no where preſcrib'd particular Inſtitutions for the Adminiſtration of the external parts of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; nor have his Apoſtles preſcrib'd enough, and without a ſufficiency of ſuch publick Worſhip can never be perform'd as it ought; and ſo there is a neceſſity for the Miniſters of the Goſpel to appoint them, if they will obey the Apoſtles Precept, of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things to Edification, decently, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet Chriſt as ſome inſinuate, is not to be thought to have leſs provided for his Church, than <hi>Moſes</hi> did for the Jewiſh, becauſe Mens own Judgments where Paſſion and Prejudice do not prevail, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the general Rules left us in Scripture, are ſufficient for making proviſion in this reſpect; whereas it was impoſſible for the wit and ſubtilty of Man to have diſcerned that it would be pleaſing to God to obſerve thoſe Typical things of the Law, which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſo critically preſcrib'd, and ſo there was a neceſſity for him to enjoyn them. Beſides, the Jews had a Liturgy, a Form of Prayers of much the ſame nature with ours, which they ordinarily uſed, and which <hi>Moſes</hi> never Inſtituted; yet he is not blamed for not appointing theſe things, nor the Jews for introducing them without a Warrant from him, or ſome other of the Prophets; as appears by Chriſt's communicating with them, and not Taxing them for theſe Innovations; So that upon the whole, what can we think but that the Miniſters of the Church are required to provide for the Adminiſtration of publick Service as the Jewiſh Doctors did; and by appointing ſuch Rites and Ceremonies as in their Judgments they ſhall think moſt expedient, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:151334:12"/>the end of our aſſembling together? And ſince the uſe of Inſtrumental Muſick is thought proper to this purpoſe, it follows, that to introduce that will be very convenient, tho' Chriſt ſpake nothing of it. And I dare ſay it will be apparently ſenſible to every unbiaſs'd Perſon who is converſant with Inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Muſick in the Church, of a grave ſound Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that it will not raiſe a light pleaſurable agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirits, nor diſtract any ones Mind, but whoſe Temper is different from that of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerallity of the World. 'Tis true, Muſick of an unſound Compoſition, may affect the Mind with lightneſs and diſtraction, as obſcene Diſcourſes may; but the other ſort of it will no more have this effect, than a Pious Diſcourſe or Unedifying Sermon, upon which account the ſtated uſe of it will be very Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable: And yet it will not follow, that therefore a Crucifix, a Death's Head, Sacrificing and the like, ought to be introduc'd too; Becauſe, 1. It would be very inconvenient to inſtitute every Thing which in its own nature might be Edifying; we ſhould then be overcharg'd with the number of them. Again, 2. There is not that power of moving the Spirits in ſuch little adumbrations now mention'd, as to juſtifie their uſe; for tho' it be ſaid,<note n="*" place="margin">A. N. p. 56.</note> Things affect more by the ſight than by the other Senſes, that is true, only of a lively ocular repreſentation of a Thing, which thoſe ſmall appearances cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to. However, I may ſafely ſay, tho' it croſs the Proverb; there is that power in the beſt ſort of Muſick, as to exerciſe a Paſſion in us, no way ſhort of what the moſt affecting repreſentations to the Eye are able to raiſe. More may be ſaid in reſpect of a Crucifix, it being a means to introduce Idolatry
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:151334:13"/>in the Minds of the Ignorant, and alſo of Sacrificing the bloodyneſs of ſuch an uſage, being no way agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Chriſtian Character. However, if any of theſe or others were thought Edifying by our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors, and enjoyn'd by them, there is no queſtion but that their Injunction were lawful, and our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience thereto a Duty.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is Objected in<note n="*" place="margin">A. N. p. 82.</note> one of our Homilies, <hi>viz.</hi> of Time and Place of Prayer, Part 2. Whereas a Perſon is ſuppoſed to refrain our Pariſh Churches, becauſe all the Saints and goodly Sights were gone, and becauſe he could not hear the like Piping, Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Playing on the Organs, as heretofore: It is Replyed, we ought to give God thanks that our Churches are deliver'd from theſe things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> From whence it is inferr'd, that Organs are accounted Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful even by the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Now here it is to be obſerv'd, that Singing is alike Condemn'd: Beſides, it is not ſaid, he could not hear any Singing, Playing on the Organs, and ſo forth, but<note n="*" place="margin">See more <hi>Newt</hi>'s Pref. to <hi>Dodwel.</hi>

            <p n="4">4. It is objected,<note n="*" place="margin">A. N. p. 83.</note> If praiſing God with Organs be lawful, than with Harps,<note n="*" place="margin">A. N. p. 83.</note> Viols, and the like, and alſo with Dancing. As for Dancing I ſhall not conſider the lawfulneſs ſo much as the fitneſs of it to be introduced in Chriſtian Aſſemblies; and ſince it doth not appear that it was uſed in the ordinary Service of the <hi>Jews,</hi> nor in any Houſe of Worſhip, but occaſionally in the Fields, Streets, or the like, upon publick Rejoycings for Bleſſings, receiv'd;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:151334:13"/>therefore there is not the ſame Reaſon for admitting Dancing as there is for admitting Organs, which were uſed in the ordinary Service of the <hi>Jews,</hi> in the great Houſe of Prayer the Temple conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and which have a great power of affecting the Mind as it ought to be, beyond what Dancing can pretend to, eſpecially now a days, which perhaps too heretofore was more an effect of religious Joy than a cauſe. Then as for Harps, Viols, and the like, no doubt they may very lawfully be uſed in our Service too, only an Organ muſt be thought better, becauſe it is a more comprehenſive Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is objected, If<note n="*" place="margin">A. N. p. 83.</note> praiſing God with Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be a fit means to raiſe Devotion, then Chriſt and his Apoſtles are to be impeached of want of Wiſdom, for not recommending it. Not ſo becauſe Man's own underſtanding could ſuggeſt it: Beſides it was enough that God approved of it in the Service of the <hi>Jews,</hi> from whence Chriſtians might borrow it. But enough hath been ſaid to take off the force of this, in my Anſwer to the ſecond Objection.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It is objected,<note n="†" place="margin">A. N. p. 84.</note> That to introduce Organs, without the Authority of Convocation or Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is contrary to the Act of Uniformity, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Supra-Conformity. Now, I ſuppoſe, becauſe Organs are not expreſly preſcribed by the Common-Prayer-Book, to eſtabliſh them is thought a new Right, for I cannot think our Adverſary will call it a new Form; and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Act doth ſay, <q>Whoſo obſtinately ſtanding in it, doth uſe any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Right than is preſcribed by the Common-Prayer-Book, ſhall ſuffer Damage.</q> Now in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:151334:14"/>the firſt place, Organs cannot be thought ſuch a Right as is forbid by this Act, becauſe the practice of all Cathedrals at the time of the making of it was to uſe Organs with their ſinging; nay, in the Queen's own Chappel they were uſed too, and were not diſuſed any where upon the promulgation of it. Again, I conceive, in that the Words obſtinately ſtanding in it are applied to make an additional Right a breach of this Act, therefore ſeveral Modes and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Worſhip, not in oppoſition to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer-Book, might be uſed with it, tho' not there expreſſed, provided they were not oppoſed by our Ordinaries, and I ſuppoſe none of them are againſt Organs. Our Objector<note n="†" place="margin">A. N. p. 84.</note> allows an Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the King would take off the force of his Argument, which tho' we cannot now plead, yet might eaſily have been obtained, no doubt, if need had required it; for it is plain his preſent Majeſty King <hi>William</hi> approves of Organs, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he frequents the places of Worſhip where they are uſed, but alſo becauſe he was pleaſed to give an Organ lately to one of our Churches in <hi>London.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Viz. St. <hi>Anns.</hi>
               </note> But that which gives more credit to the cauſe in hand than his Kingly Authority, is that he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly a ſincere Proteſtant, as appears by the unſpeakable Bravery he hath ſhewed, in undergo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a multitude of Difficulties and Dangers theſe many years laſt paſt for the ſupport of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion.</p>
            <p>If any Objections are brought againſt Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Muſick from the Authority of Schoolmen, and ſuch others, they are of force againſt light, trivial Muſick, but not againſt ſuch as I am here ſpeaking for.</p>
            <pb n="19" facs="tcp:151334:14"/>
            <p n="3">3. I come to make an Improvement of what hath been ſaid.</p>
            <p>I know many are poſſeſſed with an Opinion that all Things which are Ornamental, which in their Opinion appear Gay and Gliſtering, are to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from God's Houſe and Service, as ſavouring of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> or <hi>Popiſh</hi> Superſtition, and that no human Rite or Inſtitution whatever is to be admitted for the more orderly ſolemnization of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and ſtirring up of Piety, becauſe the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Chriſtian Worſhip they think doth imply thus much. And therefore all Arguments fetched from the Example of <hi>David,</hi> the ancient <hi>Jews</hi> or Primitive Chriſtians, are of no force with them; we muſt not beautify our Churches as the <hi>Jews</hi> did the Temple; nor make our Service edifying, come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and awful, with Ceremonies and Inſtitutions not expreſſed in Scripture, tho' we find God's own People of old did ſo all along; but why muſt we not? As to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Temple, <hi>David</hi>'s Reaſon for building and adorning that was taken from the Magnificence of his own Houſe, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.2. <hi>See,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I dwell in an houſe of Cedar, but the ark of God remaineth within Curtains:</hi> And ſurely we have the ſame Reaſon to argue thus, Shall we take care to build ſumptuous, magnificent Houſes for ourſelves, and yet not be concerned to ſee the Houſe of God of a mean Building, rough and unpoliſhed? Surely though God cannot be ſaid to live in an Houſe made with Hands, yet whatſoever is dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to his Service ought to be ſet off in ſuch a manner as to beſpeak the Dignity of him, as far as according to our Abilities it is reaſonable we ſhould: For he that abhorred thoſe who ſacrificed
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:151334:15"/>the worſt of their Cattle, ſaying, <hi>Offer it now unto thy Governor, will he be pleaſed with thee or accept thy Perſon?</hi> Mal. 1.8. will have the ſame Reaſon to ſay in the preſent Caſe, <q>Is this an Houſe fit for my Name to be called upon in? Give it for an entertaining Houſe to your Prince: See if he will thank you.</q> The Primitive Chriſtians, as oft as they had reſpite from Perſecutions, were very induſtrious in erecting ſtately Churches, and adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them ſplendidly; ſo that they were of the ſame mind we are in this matter.</p>
            <p>Then as to the Jewiſh Service; Since it is lawful for us to make uſe of a Liturgy, Compos'd by the Miniſters of the Church, as I ſhew'd in my Anſwer to the ſecond Objection, how can we do better than tranſplant thoſe of the Jewiſh Inſtitutions into our Service, which apparently tend to promote Piety? Since becauſe no Reaſon can be given why ſuch ſhould be thought ſo aboliſh'd by the coming of Chriſt, as to be made uncapable of being admitted among the Chriſtian Ordinances; we muſt needs think they are as likely to be pleaſing to God now, as any other not more edifying than they; and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially too ſince part of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Service, <hi>viz.</hi> Singing of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> is recommended by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.</p>
            <p>But it is ſaid, it is contrary to the ſimplicity of Chriſtian Worſhip to do ſo. No ſurely, ſince Chriſtians are Men, endued with Paſſions, whoſe Faculties are to be wrought upon by impreſſions upon the outward Senſes. I conceive the ſimplicity of Chriſtian Worſhip conſiſts in a due qualification of the Heart and Mind in the Service of God. Now the external Beauty of God's Houſe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:151334:15"/>Ceremonies (as I have ſhewed before) have a natural tendency to make ſuch Impreſſions upon us, and therefore they are very conſiſtent with the ſimplicity of Chriſtian Worſhip. But the Word and Sacraments are thought ſufficient to effect this. 'Tis true, they are the chief Cauſes of begetting a good Diſpoſition in us; but thoſe who urge this would do well conſider, that Chriſt in his Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Holy Supper, hath ordained that the Bread ſhall be broken; undoubtedly to repreſent how his Body was broken on the Croſs, and by ſuch a viſible Repreſentation to excite in us the greater Senſe of his Sufferings, and thereby more effectually to raiſe our Devotion; and from hence they may gather that our Lord doth approve of ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant Rites and Ceremonies. Alas, our Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are dull and heavy, there is need of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Helps to raiſe them up, and it is eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable what an influence Impreſſions upon the outward Senſes have in the Mind. 'Tis true, if we content our ſelves with the external peformance of Ceremonies, or ſuffer our Minds to be taken up with an idle Contemplation of the Ornaments and Decencies of the Church, then are we Strangers to the ſimplicity of Chriſtian Worſhip; but if upon the ſight of theſe Things, and the uniform admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Service, we take occaſion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template upon the Glories of our Heavenly Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the unanimous Conſort of Angels prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God in Heaven, and be thereby excited to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the Heavenly Hoſt with more Fervor; and if to the outward performance of each Ceremony we ſuit our Affections, then is our Worſhip according to Chriſtian Simplicity; and this uſe may every
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:151334:16"/>one make of the Ornaments and Decencies of the Church, and it is the only deſign of theſe Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that they ſhould. Our Ceremonies are not nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous like the Popiſh, nor burthenſome like the purely Jewiſh; they are not impoſed as Duties in their own nature binding, but enjoined for the ſake of their fitneſs to promote thoſe Affections which ſhould be in every Chriſtians Breaſt while lei ſerving his God. And I dare ſay, as the obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of them is no way difficult to any, and the number of them but barely ſufficient to render our Service decent and orderly, and to preſerve it from dryneſs and barrenneſs, ſo there is not one of our Inſtitutions which hath not a natural tendency to excite our Affections ſuitably, or which cannot plead ſubſtantial Reaſons for its appointment.</p>
            <p>To ſum up all, our Ordinances are not <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> becauſe we have nothing in them peculiar to that State; nor <hi>Popiſh,</hi> becauſe we have none but what are of good uſe, and becauſe we aſcribe no Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Efficacy to the external performance of them; neither are they contrary to the ſimplicity of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Worſhip, becauſe by reaſon of their fewneſs they do not diſtract the Mind, and by reaſon of their ſuitableneſs to excite religious Affections, they further Piety in the Heart. Neither are they addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the Word or Doctrins, ſuch as our Saviour ſpake againſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.9. becauſe we aſcribe no Grace to the outward performance of them, as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> did to the waſhing Cups, Pots, and the like; nor do we impoſe them as divine Precepts, nor do they contradict any Command of God, as the Traditions of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> did, upon which our Saviour, in the forecited-place, pronounced,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:151334:16"/>
               <hi>In vain do they worſhip me, teaching for Doctrins the Commandments of Men.</hi> Therefore they are not ſuch Doctrins, no theſe are ſuch pious Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our Rulers in obedience to the Apoſtle's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, and our own Reaſon, as our Lord himſelf, in compliance with <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Cuſtoms, obſerved; ſuch as the ſinging a Paſchal Hymn after the Paſſover, <hi>Mark.</hi> 14.26. uſing the Cup of Charity in the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſover. <hi>Luke.</hi> 22.16. Which was no part of the Inſtitution; and therefore if we will imitate Chriſt we muſt comply with ſuch Inſtitutions too. Nay, we have a Command, to <hi>Submit to every Ordinance of Man for the Lord</hi>'s <hi>ſake,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. And I know no Scripture that makes an exception of ſuch Ordinances as relate to the adminiſtration of Divine Service, or outward diſcipline in the Church, nor doth Reaſon ſuggeſt an exception, unleſs of ſuch as tend to advance Superſtition and the like, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I cannot ſee what excuſe they can have who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to ſubmit to ſuch pious Ordinances as our Church preſcribes. I heartily beg thoſe who are averſe to our Communion, not only to conſider the danger of Schiſm, which they are highly guilty of notwithſtanding the Tolleration, but the Reaſon and Ground of all our Conſtitutions, and then I Queſtion not but many will ſee their Error; for I am very apt to believe that the cauſe why moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from us, is becauſe they do not acquaint them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the deſign of our Ordinances, and ſo are ignorant of their agreeableneſs to the Solemnity of publick Worſhip. Thus I have read of one <hi>Capito</hi> a famous Paſtor in <hi>Bremen,</hi> who was accuſtomed to inveigh moſt ſtrangly againſt Organs, calling them the Devils Pipes; but afterwards, when the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:151334:17"/>Magiſtrates of the Place had erected an Organ in his Church, then did he extol them as much, calling their Muſick Heavenly, Angelical Melody, and what not? Now I aſcribe his former Prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Organs to his Ignorance of the Power and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſluence of them; as in like manner I aſcribe the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices of thoſe among us, who are Enemies to them and our other Conſtitutions, to their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their uſefulneſs. Oh! what an Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs would it be if we were all of one Mind, if there were no Diviſions among us, but that we did with one Mind and one Mouth, glorifie God even the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as the Apoſtle prays, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15-6. But alas! this cannot be expected till Men can reſolve to reject their prejudices and peviſh humors, till they are convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that as it is the duty of every one to prevent Diviſion and Faction as much as in them lies, and to endeavour ſincerely after Unity, ſo there is no poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of effecting this, except they can humbly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the determination of Rulers, in matters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to outward Order and Diſcipline in the Church, comply with cuſtomary Rites, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently enquire into the Reaſon of Things, except they can think themſelves may be miſtaken in their Judgment, when ſome things ſeem unfit for the ends they are deſign'd; and that however their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is, to ſubmit to all the Ordinances of Man, which are not breaches of God's Law, in regard the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle commands it, and alſo in regard by doing other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they ſhall diſturb the Peace of the Church, which every one is bound to promote. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith,<note n="*" place="margin">1 Theſ. 5.21.</note> 
               <hi>Try all things and hold fast to that which is good;</hi> and how ſhall we try? not by our own
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:151334:17"/>Fancies and Humors, but by the Word of God, according as we find the <hi>Bereans</hi> did try the Doctrin of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> Acts 17.11. And the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, though they do not in particular preſcribe our Conſtitutions, nor indeed the Rites of any So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Chriſtians in the World which hath the feweſt, yet do they in general preſcribe Decencies (as I ſhewed before) command Obedience to the Injunctions of Superiors, and expreſly mention ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Conſtitutions lawfully introduced by the <hi>Jews,</hi> (which <hi>Moſes</hi> never appointed, nor God) to whom it was altogether as unlawful to ordain Things in the Service of God as it is to us; and farther, the Scriptures mightily ſet forth the Duty of Unity and the danger of Schiſm; all which being weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and conſidered impartially, who can conclude but that our Governors are enjoined even from the Word of God to preſcribe ſuch Ordinances as they have, and that we alſo from the fame Word are bound to ſubmit to them? Then what remains? But that every one be careful to preſerve the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace, that they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent our Aſſemblies and comply with our Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, attending to the true End and Deſign of them; that ſo our Hearts may be affected agreeably as they ought to be, that ſo we may ſerve God with one Accord in one Place, be of one Mind, have true Fellowſhip with Chriſt and with one another, and be encloſed in that one Fold, over which there is one Shepherd, Jeſus Chriſt our only Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
